NAME
    WWW::Baidu - Perl interface for the www.baidu.com search engine

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of "WWW::Baidu", released Jan 21,
    2007.

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Baidu;
        my $baidu = WWW::Baidu->new;
        # ensure the keys are in the GBK/GB2312 encoding if they're Chinese
        my $count = $baidu->search('Perl "Larry Wall"', 'Audrey');
        $baidu->limit(200);
        while (my $record = $baidu->next) {
            # the results are in GBK/GB2312 encoding
            print $record->title, "\n",
                  $record->url, "\n",
                  $record->summary, "\n",
                  $record->date, "\n",
                  $record->size, "\n",
                  $record->cached_url, "\n\n\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Baidu.com is a very popular Chinese search engine which does similar
    things as Google. This module provides you with a Perl interface to that
    site.

METHODS
    "$obj = WWW::Baidu->new()"
    "$obj = WWW::Baidu->new( cache => $cache )"
        This is the constructor for "WWW::Baidu". It accepts an optional
        argument which will must be a Cache::Cache-compatible object.
        "WWW::Baidu" will use this cache instead of a default
        "Cache::FileCache" instance.

    "$count = $obj->search($key1, $key2, ...)"
        Searches Baidu by the given keys and returns the total records
        reported by Baidu. Note that the return value $count is only an
        estimation by Baidu. Usually it's not equal to the total number of
        records that you can fetch by the "next" method.

        It's highly recommended to pass only string keys in the GBK or
        GB2312 encoding.

        A call of this method will clear the internal search results' buffer
        and the iterator counter, but the "limit" setting is left intact.

    "$obj->limit($count)"
        Limits the total number of records WWW::Baidu will try to offer.
        This method will affect the "next()" method. And the internal
        counter will also get cleared if the "search" method is called
        again.

    "$record = $obj->next()"
        Returns the next search result which is a WWW::Baidu::Record object.
        "WWW::Baidu" accesses the baidu.com site rather lazily. That is, it
        only "clicks" the "Next page" link in case that the user has fetched
        all the records in the internal buffer.

        When there's no more records (due to the capability of Baidu itself
        or the upper-limit set via the "limit" method), this method will
        return undef.

CACHING
    "WWW::Baidu" uses WWW::Mechanize::Cached internally so that your program
    will run much faster during debugging and will also behave more politely
    to the Baidu.com site.

CAVEAT
    *   The values returned by the WWW::Baidu::Record objects' properties
        are always in the GBK (or GB2312) encoding. If you want unicode
        semantics, please decode the results using the Encode module
        yourself. :)

        It's not a bug in WWW::Baidu.

    *   Althogh "WWW::Baidu" has tried very hard to behave politely to
        Baidu.com via both caching, limiting, and lazy iteration, it's still
        important for the user not to abuse it.

        During debugging, it's highly recommended to fix your search keys
        fed into the "search" method, so that "WWW::Baidu" can take
        advantage of the caching facility and your scripts will also run
        swiftly without the pain of accessing the web.

        Please don't punish others' sites for your own programming mistakes.
        :)
